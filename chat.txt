VFDan - We can chat with this file.
VFDan - Do you have Discord? It might be easier to chat there.
MiniCoder11 - Can't do Discord. How should we start this project?
MiniCoder11 - Should I create plan.txt with a to do list?
VFDan - Any other chat application? It would be much easier to do it in a chat application, as it would be real time, and we don't have to keep refreshing.
VFDan - Sure.
MiniCoder11 - Unless you want to use Scratch chat? I get live notifications through an external website whenever I get a message.
